# My own Simon Game

For the old-appjs.text: This is a game project that I did by my self. All of this project is coded by my self.

for the actual app.js the code is inspired by FCC simon game video. I changed some part of the code from the video.

You can find HTML CSS and JS in this project

I had a lot of fun during this project and learned a lot about setTimeout and setInterval and other many things !
